Q.How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
Ans:
git reset --soft HEAD~1 
	after commit it will go to staging area(add . changes remain same)


	git reset HEAD filename
Replace "filename" with the actual name of the file to unstage. 

to unstage all changes:
	git reset HEAD .
This command resets the staging area, but it leaves the working directory unchanged. changes will still be present in working directory.
