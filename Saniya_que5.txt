Q.Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

Ans:
git push --force-with-lease is a safer alternative to git push --force.
It allows you to push changes to the remote branch only if the remote branch is at the same commit as the one you have locally.
If the remote branch has been updated by someone else, the push will be rejected, preventing accidental overwrites.

1)git push --force:
	This command will still push if there is extra commit on remote branch


2)git push --force-with-lease
	This command will not let you push if there is extra commit on remote branch

scenario 

--force-with-lease is used in Git when you need to forcefully push changes to a remote branch 
while avoiding overwriting others' changes, especially in collaborative environments or when dealing with branch protection rules on Git hosting platforms.
