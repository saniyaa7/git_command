Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 

Ans:
Squash is used to combine multiple commit to one commit.

To combine two commits (C2 and C3) into a single commit in Git:

Run git rebase -i HEAD~4 in the terminal.
Change pick to edit for both C2 and C3.
For each commit, run:

git reset HEAD~1
git add -A
git commit --amend
Complete the rebase with git rebase --continue.
This process combines C2 and C3 into one commit. 

git push -f origin BRANCH_NAME
this forcefully push the commits to remote server
