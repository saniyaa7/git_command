Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.

Define a git remote which will point to multiple git remotes.
Say, we call it “all”: git remote add all  REMOTE_URL_A.

 git remote set-url --add --push all REMOTE_URL_A.
 git remote set-url --add --push all REMOTE_URL_B.
Push a branch to all the remotes with git push all BRANCH – replace BRANCH with a real branch name.
You cannot pull from multiple remotes, but you can fetch updates from multiple remotes with git fetch --all
